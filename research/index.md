Recent years have witnessed rapidly growing interest in MXene-based materials for advanced sensing and wearable biomedical applications. Owing to their outstanding electrical conductivity, large specific surface area, mechanical flexibility, and rich surface chemistry, MXenes have emerged as promising candidates for flexible sensors capable of monitoring pressure, strain, physiological signals, and biochemical parameters. Their two-dimensional layered structure enables efficient signal transduction under mechanical deformation, making them particularly suitable for wearable electronics and human–machine interfaces.

Moreover, the intrinsic hydrophilicity and biocompatibility of MXenes facilitate their integration into biomedical platforms for health monitoring, diagnostics, and implantable or skin-mounted devices. These unique properties position MXenes as a new class of functional materials bridging sensors, wearable systems, and biomedical technologies.

Nanomedicine, propelled by advancements in nanotechnology, has significantly advanced cancer treatment by enabling precise, targeted, and minimally invasive therapeutic strategies. Among these, phototherapy (PT), including photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), has attracted significant attention due to its ability to selectively eradicate cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. These bioinspired nanomaterials exhibit enhanced biocompatibility, improved targeting efficiency, and controlled degradation, optimizing PTT and PDT performance.

The paper illustrates nanoparticles of various compositions, including gold, silica, and carbon-based structures, emphasizing their surface functionalization for drug delivery and phototherapy. These nanoparticles are shown dispersed in a colloidal medium, highlighting their dynamic behavior. A directed light source, such as a laser or visible light, activates the nanomaterials. This activation triggers the nanoparticles´ phototoxic effects or the release of therapeutic agents, leading to the destruction of cancer cells.

The growing field of nanotechnology has witnessed numerous advancements over the past few years, particularly in the development of engineered nanoparticles. Compared with bulk materials, metal nanoparticles possess more favorable properties, such as increased chemical activity and toxicity, owing to their smaller size and larger surface area. Metal nanoparticles can be modified with different targeting agents such as antibodies, liposomes, transferrin, folic acid, and carbohydrates. Thus, metal nanoparticles hold great promise for various biomedical applications such as photoacoustic imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography (CT), photothermal, and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Despite their potential, safety considerations, and regulatory hurdles must be addressed for safe clinical applications.

This review highlights advancements in metal nanoparticle surface engineering and explores their integration with emerging technologies such as bioimaging, cancer therapeutics and nanomedicine. By offering valuable insights, this comprehensive review offers a deep understanding of the potential of metal nanoparticles in biomedical research.
