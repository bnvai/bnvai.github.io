# Feature {#next-section}
<!-- ===================================================== -->
<!-- Flexible Hydrogel Materials -->
<!-- ===================================================== -->
{% capture flexible_text %}
Our research on flexible hydrogel materials focuses on the design and engineering of soft, biocompatible systems that can seamlessly interface with human skin and biological tissues. By leveraging advanced polymer chemistry, such as methacrylated gelatin and calcium alginate hydrogels, we develop materials capable of controlled drug delivery, moisture regulation, and mechanical adaptability.

These flexible hydrogels are engineered to mimic the mechanical properties of natural tissues, enabling enhanced wound healing outcomes and long-term stability in wearable and implantable applications. This research lays the foundation for next-generation wound dressings and therapeutic platforms that combine comfort, functionality, and clinical effectiveness.

<!-- ===================================================== -->
<!-- Point-of-Care Diagnostics -->
<!-- ===================================================== -->
{% capture poc_text %}
We develop point-of-care diagnostic systems that enable rapid, non-invasive assessment of wound conditions directly at the site of care. Our approach integrates pH-sensitive fluorophores and hydrogel-based matrices to visually and quantitatively monitor biochemical changes associated with infection and healing progression.

By translating physiological signals such as wound pH into optical or electronic readouts, these diagnostic platforms provide clinicians and patients with immediate, actionable information. This research aims to improve early detection of complications, reduce treatment delays, and support personalized wound management strategies.

<!-- ===================================================== -->
<!-- Wearable Bioelectronics -->
<!-- ===================================================== -->
{% capture wearable_text %}
Our wearable bioelectronics research explores the integration of flexible electronics with textiles and skin-mounted systems to enable continuous physiological monitoring. Utilizing conductive fabrics, thin-film electrodes, and soft interconnects, we design devices that maintain electrical performance while preserving user comfort and mobility.

These wearable platforms are optimized for long-term use in daily life, allowing real-time monitoring of wound status, biomechanical activity, and environmental interactions. This work bridges materials science and electronic engineering to advance the development of next-generation healthcare wearables.

<!-- ===================================================== -->
<!-- Smart Wound Patches -->
<!-- ===================================================== -->
{% capture smartpatch_text %}
We investigate smart wound patches that combine biosensing, wireless communication, and flexible materials into a single integrated platform. These systems incorporate interdigitated electrodes, biosensing modules, and NFC-based wireless interfaces to enable real-time data acquisition and contactless readout using mobile devices.

Smart wound patches provide a powerful tool for continuous wound monitoring, enabling timely interventions and data-driven clinical decisions. This research supports the transition from passive wound dressings to intelligent, connected healthcare solutions.
