The NBMInno lab was created in the spring of 2025

### Research Interests

The research interests of our lab broadly span many areas of computational biology and bioinformatics. Some of our main areas of interest include:

- Flexible Materials for Targeted Drug Delivery:
- These are highly flexible hydrogels, like methacrylated gelatin, that can conform to body surfaces (skin or internal). They are designed to carry therapeutic drugs and release them in a controlled way directly at the site of need, improving treatment effectiveness and potentially reducing side effects.

- Point-of-Care Diagnostics for Rapid Assessment:
- This involves hydrogels, such as calcium alginate with pH-sensitive fluorophores, used in tools for quick diagnostics. When applied to a wound, they detect local pH levels through changes in fluorescence. This allows for immediate, on-the-spot assessment of wound conditions (like infection or healing) without requiring complex lab equipment.

- Wearable Devices for Continuous Health Monitoring:
- This shows hydrogel technology integrated into wearable items, like flexible electronic skin (FES) patches made from materials like cloth and silver fabric. Worn directly on the skin, these devices can incorporate sensors (e.g., to detect bacteria) to continuously monitor physiological signals or environmental factors, providing real-time health data.

- Smart Patches for Advanced Wound Care and Connectivity:
- These are advanced "smart" wound dressings that combine healing capabilities with monitoring and wireless communication. They feature a sophisticated biosensing module (with components like silicone pillars, DNAgel, and electrodes) to detect wound conditions. An included NFC module allows the patch to wirelessly transmit this data to a smartphone, enabling remote patient monitoring and potentially personalized treatment.
