The NBMInno lab was created in the spring of 2025. What is more ?

### Research Interests

The research interests of our lab broadly span many areas of computational biology and bioinformatics. Some of our main areas of interest include:

1. Flexible Materials: Flexible hydrogels deliver drugs directly where needed for better treatment.
2. Point-of-Care Diagnostics: Hydrogel sensors quickly check wound pH on the spot using fluorescence.
3. Wearable Devices: Wearable hydrogel patches track health signals from the skin in real-time.
4. Smart Patches: Intelligent hydrogel dressings sense wound conditions and wirelessly send data for monitoring.
