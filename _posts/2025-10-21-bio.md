The research team recently published the paper titled **“Advancements, Challenges, and Future Perspectives of MXenes in Biomedicine”** in _Wiley SmartMat_, a globally recognized journal ranked within the **top 6.5%** in the fields of chemistry and materials science.

#### Overview of the research

The published paper presents research findings on the application of **MXene**, a material that has recently attracted significant attention in the field of advanced materials, in **biomedicine**. The study serves as a milestone in advancing research related to the biomedical use of MXene-based materials.

MXene is a two-dimensional nanomaterial composed of alternating metal and carbon layers. It is often regarded as a **dream material** due to its high electrical conductivity and its versatility, which arises from the wide range of compound combinations that can be formed. In this paper, the research team explored the potential of MXene in biomedicine and discussed strategies for applying this novel material in advanced biomedical fields.

#### Research collaboration

Professor Junghwan Oh conducted this research in collaboration with **master’s student Thi Nath Lin Phan**, **Professor Sudip Mondal**, and **Professor Umapada Pal** from the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla, Mexico. This international collaboration played a key role in achieving the reported results.

#### Expert commentary

Professor Sudip Mondal stated that this research achievement is expected to provide an important opportunity to **promote the development of biomedical research** and to **foster global research collaboration**.

#### Funding support

This research was supported by the **2024 Global Collaborative Research Program** of the **National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)** and **Pukyong National University**.
