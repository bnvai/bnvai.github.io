Hello everyone! How’s your day going? Hope you’re all doing well!

Let me introduce myself-I’m Truong Thi Thuy (you can call me Thuy!). I graduated from PetroVietnam University in 2022 with a degree in Chemical Engineering. Early in 2023, I arrived in this beautiful country, Korea, to continue my academic journey. Here, I studied biomedical engineering in the “Industry 4.0 Convergence Bionics Engineering” department at Pukyong National University.

Thanks to the enthusiastic support of my advisor, seniors, and dear friends, I successfully earned my Master’s degree in early 2025. Now, I’m pursuing my PhD here! My research focuses on nanomaterials for sensing and biomedical applications, tissue engineering, biomolecules, and therapeutics-super fascinating, right?

In my free time, I love listening to audiobooks, taking walks, and… well, lying flat on my bed on weekends.

Thank you for listening. Welcome to our lab’s page. ^^
