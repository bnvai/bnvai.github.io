  description: salmon is a tool for efficient, accurate, and bias-aware transcript quantification from RNA-seq data
  repo: nanobiomedical/salmon
  url: https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wnan.1504

- title: alevin-fry
  type: nanobiomedical
  image: images/salmon_logo.png
  description: alevin-fry is a suite of tools for processing single-cell sequencing data. It consumes RAD files generated by alevin, and performs common operations like generating permit lists, and estimating the number of distinct molecules from each gene within each cell. The focus in alevin-fry is on safety, accuracy and efficiency (in terms of both time and memory usage).

- title: deBGR
  type: nanobiomedical
  repo: splatlab/deBGR
  description: deBGR a memory-efficient and near-exact representation of the weighted de Bruijn Graph. Our representation is based upon a recently-introduced counting filter data structure which, itself, provides an approximate representation of the weighted de Bruijn Graph.
